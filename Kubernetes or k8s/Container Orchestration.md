## What is container Orchestration?

> "Container orchestration is the process of automating the deployment, management, scaling, and networking tasks of containers.  
> It can be used in any environment where you use containers and can help you deploy the same application across different environments without requiring any redesigning".

Assume that you've containerized the application using Docker and deployed it on AWS.

If the application goes down for any reason, the users lose access to your service immediately.
To solve this issue, you can make multiple copies or replicas of the same application and make it highly available so that even if one of the instances goes down, the other two will be available to the users.

Now assume that your application has become wildly popular among the night owls and your servers are being flooded with requests at night, while you're sleeping.

What if all the instances go down due to overload? Who's going to do the scaling? Even if you scale up and make 50 replicas of your application, who's going to check on their health? How are going to set-up the networking so that requests hit the right endpoint?

[[Kubernetes]] can make things much easier for these kinds of situations. 
## What is container orchestration used for?

Use container orchestration to automate and manage tasks such as:

- Provisioning and deployment
- Configuration and scheduling 
- Resource allocation
- Container availability 
- Scaling or removing containers based on balancing workloads across your infrastructure
- Load balancing and traffic routing 
- Monitoring container health
- Configuring applications based on the container in which they will run
- Keeping interactions between containers secure

## Tools
Popular container orchestration tools used for container lifecycle management. Some popular options are [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/), [Docker Swarm](https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/), and [Apache Mesos](https://mesos.apache.org/).
