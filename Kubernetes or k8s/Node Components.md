Node components run on every node, maintaining running pods and providing the Kubernetes runtime environment.

**kubelet**
An agent that runs on each node in the cluster. It makes sure that containers are running in a Pod.

The kubelet takes a set of PodSpecs that are provided through various mechanisms and ensures that the containers described in those PodSpecs are running and healthy. The kubelet doesn't manage con


**kube-proxy**
kube-proxy is a network proxy that runs on each [node](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/nodes/) in your cluster, implementing part of the Kubernetes [Service](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/) concept.

[kube-proxy](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/command-line-tools-reference/kube-proxy/) maintains network rules on nodes. These network rules allow network communication to your Pods from network sessions inside or outside of your cluster.

kube-proxy uses the operating system packet filtering layer if there is one and it's available. Otherwise, kube-proxy forwards the traffic itself.
