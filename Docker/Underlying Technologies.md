## Namespaces:
- **Purpose**: Create Isolated work environments for processes.
- **Working**: Namespaces restrict what a process can see and interact with in terms of system resources. 

## Union File Systems(UFS)

- **Purpose**: Efficient layering of the filesystem to create the containers filesystem.
- **Working**: UFS stacks multiple read-only layers first then finally stacks a write only layer on top. 

## Control Groups(cgroups)

- **Purpose**: Limit and monitor the resource usage of processes or groups of processes.
- **Working**: Cgroups allow you to set limits on CPU, RAM, I/O and device.
